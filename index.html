                <p>My name is Mark and I'm a computer science major at the University of California, San Diego  . During my time there, I have done several projects both inside and outside the classroom, and have become more interested in phenomenon within computer science. This site serves as showcase for those projects and interests, as well as being an opportunity to further practice my web development skills.</p>

                        <p>I'm currently brushing up on web-development (namely: HTML5, CSS, and some JavaScript) to build the very website you're reading this on!</p>
                        <p>This is a long-term project and I plan to update it with new content regularly. Picking colors for my UI elements and having content scale properly for mobile devices is also giving me more practice with UI design, and maintaining a changelog is giving me practice with software versioning. You can learn more by reading the changelog <a href="./changelog.html">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>Using Java applets I created a GUI for the text-based 2048 game that I made. The GUI consists of the game title in the upper left, a score in the upper right, a background with placeholder squares, and the game tiles themselves. Each number square has a different color value. When combining squares, an animation ensures the motion is seamless. If <a href="./genderless_pronouns.html">perse</a> makes an invalid move, a warning prompt appears on the screen. When the game is finished, a "game over" message appears on screen, and the game ends. Once the game ends, any further interaction is blocked.</p>

                            <p>A text-based version of the famous 2048 game. The game is entirely run through the terminal.  It supports the following flags: "-i", "-o", and "-s". The user can use the -i flag and a filename of a saved board to resume where perse left off. The user can also use the -o flag and a filepath to tell the game where to save the board. Finally, the user can use the -s flag and a number n to tell the game what board size perse wants, where the board will be n x n tiles.</p>
                            <p>The user can also choose to start a new game by not passing in the -i flag. Upon initialization of a new game, the program generates a new board with 2 randomly placed tiles (either 2's or 4's). From then, the user can move the tiles up, left, down, and right with the W, A, S, and D keys respectively. If the user wants to save the game, perse can press the Q key to save the state of the board and the score to the default filepath or the filepath specified in the -o flag.</p>
                            <p>If the user makes an invalid move, a warning prompt will appear in the terminal, and a usage message will be printed to the screen. When the game ends, a prompt saying "GAME OVER" will be printed to the terminal and the game will end. Once the game ends, any further interaction is blocked.</p>

Upon initialization of a new game, the program generates a new board with 2 randomly placed tiles (either 2's or 4's). From then, the user can move the tiles up, left, down, and right with the W, A, S, and D keys respectively. If the user wants to save the game, perse can press the Q key to save the state of the board and the score to the default filepath or the filepath specified in the -o flag.</p>
                            <p>If the user makes an invalid move, a warning prompt will appear in the terminal, and a usage message will be printed to the screen. When the game ends, a prompt saying "GAME OVER" will be printed to the terminal and the game will end. Once the game ends, any further interaction is blocked.</p>

                            <p>This simple utility outputs a random maze pattern consisting of '/' and '\' symbols just for fun. Inspired by an older computer program written in BASIC – this modern interpretation is written in C.</p>
                            <p>To use, pass in two numbers, C and R, where C is the number of columns and R is the number of rows that you want printed.</p>

                            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
                            <p>Data breaches, malware, and other attacks can put our personal information in danger. Every year, tons of sites are compromised, which leads to distrust and the stolen information can potentially be used for crime.</p>
                            <p>My primary interests include: encryption methods, strategies to preempt of attackers, malware distribution, decentralized information storage, read only disk partitions, and physical security keys/passworldless accounts.</p>
                            <p>With this, we can decrease the risk of our data getting into the wrong hands.</p>

                            <p>With open source code, many contributors can work on the project. This means that the best minds are free to work on the project, which translates to more efficient, more secure, more reliable code, with more features than closed source counterparts.</p>
                            <p>The transparency achieved by making the source code publicly available means the end user is free to look through the code so that perse can look at how the program works make sure there isn't any malicious code. Additionally, the transparency also makes the company producing the software more credible.</p>

                            <p>People are not property, but our personal information is being treated like property – being bought and sold from one company to another.</p>
                            <p>With more and more websites collecting some sort of information from us, I think it's time for a change.</p>
                            <p>I believe our information should be private unless there is a valid reason for it to be public. Online privacy should be the default, not something the user must opt-in to.</p>

                            <p>Defined as anything that a human uses to interact with a computer, such as a touch screen, mouse, keyboard, headset, webcam, microphone, speaker, and more.</p>
                            <p>Without the proper precautions, extended computer use can lead to serious injury such as repetitive strain injury (RSI) or carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
                            <p>Since people are becoming increasingly reliant on technology – some spend hours in front of computers every day – I'm interested in how we can make these devices more ergonomic so that people are confortable for extended sessions in front of the computer.</p>

                            <p>My high school completely lacked computer science curriculum of any sort – it wasn't until I got to college that I was able to take computer science courses in a classroom setting.</p>
                            <p>This experience made me think about how we can get computer science curriculum into more schools and get more young students interested in the field.</p>
                            <p>I'm also interested in how we can make computer science education better at a college level through various means such as Peer Instruction.</p>

                            <p>A few years ago, I switched from a membrane keyboard to a mechanical keyboard and haven't looked back.</p>
                            <p>Mechanical keyboards are way nicer to type on, are far more durable, more customizable, and easier to repair than membrane keyboards. I recommend them to anyone who types a lot who doesn't have one already.</p>
                            <p>I've tried several different boards over the years, and have recently gotten into building my own custom mechs.</p>
