                            <p>Rainy City was my group's final project for my computer graphics class. My two teammates and I were given less than three weeks to implement various graphical features and tie it all together with a creative storyline.</p>

                            <p>Here was our storyline that earned us full points for creativity: Once upon a time, there was a duck, a penguin, and an ostrich. Despite their obvious differences, they were best friends. United by a desire to fly like all the rest of the birds, they banded together and created a hot air balloon. They boarded the hot air balloon and began flying, fulfilling their lifelong dream together. Their first destination was Rainy City, a city perched in the mountains, known for its rainy weather. On the day of their maiden flight upon approach to Rainy City, acid rain caused the hot air balloon to come crashing to the ground, and all three perished. After the tragic incident, the denizens of Rainy City decided to construct a hot air balloon monument to remember them by.</p>

                            <p>As Project Manager, I assigned the remaining team members their roles, handled team logistics (such as our twice-a-week code review sessions, team meeting times, and filming days for the final demonstration video), resolved intra-team disputes, gave the software development team deadlines to ensure that we met our target, and created documentation for our app's various features.</p>
                            <p>Our app curated listing data from multiple sites such as Zillow, apartments.com, and more, and allowed the user to view all of that information in one place.</p>
