                <h3>Fade to Black</h3>
                <p>Life it seems will fade away
                <br>Drifting further everyday
                <br>Getting lost within myself
                <br>Nothing matters no one else
                <br>I have lost the will to live
                <br>Simply nothing more to give
                <br>There is nothing more for me
                <br>Need the end to set me free
                <br>Things not what they used to be
                <br>Missing one inside of me
                <br>Deadly loss this can't be real
                <br>Cannot stand this Hell I feel
                <br>Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony
                <br>Growing darkness taking dawn
                <br>I was me but now, he's gone
                <br>No one but me can save myself, but its too late
                <br>Now I can't think, think why I should even try
                <br>Yesterday seems as though it never existed
                <br>Death greets me warm, now I will just say "Goodbye"
                <br>"Goodbye"</p>
