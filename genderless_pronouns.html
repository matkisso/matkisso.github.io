                <h1>Better Genderless Pronouns in English</h1>
                <p>You can read Richard Stallman's original article <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/genderless-pronouns.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>A Brief Overview of the Article:</h2>
                <p>The increasing number of people who do not wish to identify with a specific gender has posed a problem with the English language in recent years. In the past, <b>we would usually address everyone as ‘he’, but that is now viewed as sexist</b>, and addressing everyone as ‘she’ is just <b>reverse sexism</b>. Addressing people as “he or she” or “he/she” is cumbersome and does not account for those who identify as genderless. Society tells us we should use ‘they’ to describe these people, but <b>this is problematic – and here’s why.</b></p>
                <p><b>The word ‘they’ is plural, not singular.</b> Richard M. Stallman, one of the most brilliant computer scientists of all time (of GNU Project fame), wrote an article on his website to address the issue. In the article, he claims the use of ‘they’ as a singular pronoun <b>“violates the grammar of English so deeply that it feels terribly wrong.”</b> and I agree. If you still aren’t convinced, Stallman’s article presents several good examples of why using ‘they’ as a singular genderless pronoun is not ideal. (which I have reproduced below)</p>
                <div class="chart">
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matkisso/matkisso.github.io/master/resources/pronoun_examples.jpg" class="chart-image">
                </div>
                <p>He concedes that you can probably figure out what the sentences are intended to mean with a little thought, but <b>that doesn't mean that the use of "they" is confusing and ambiguous.</b> He also concedes that <b>sometimes this ambiguity can lead to clever humor,</b> but that <b>clever humor isn't ideal for professional writing.</b></p>
                <p>That’s great and all, but <i>what should we do instead?</i> Stallman proposes <b>using an artificial new pronoun</b> <i>that fits into the English language well.</i> He claims that the best solution is to use the pronouns coined by Marge Piercy: <b>‘person’, ‘per’, and ‘pers’.</b> These new pronouns are easy to remember, and since the last two sound like ‘her’ and ‘hers’, the new pronouns will roll off the tongue easier. <b>Since Stallman finds ‘person’ too slow to say, he uses the alternative ‘perse’ instead.</b> Although ‘perse’ sounds like ‘purse’, in practice confusion between the two is impossible due to context clues within sentences. I encourage you to read Stallman’s article to see an example of why this is.</p>
                <p>Stallman’s article claims that <b>we should not have to conform English grammar to address everyone by per pronouns.</b> Again, his article presents a good example of why this practice is confusing. If you still aren’t convinced, try reading something like Sam Smith’s Wikipedia page – where every pronoun is replaced by the plural gender-neutral counterpart – <b>it doesn’t make sense.</b> Instead, Stallman argues that we should use the alternative gender-neutral pronouns to avoid confusion.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My Opinion:</h2>
                <p>I agree that Stallman’s suggestion of using ‘perse’, ‘per’ and ‘pers’ presents <b>a perfect way to solve this modern-day conundrum</b>, however the article's format could use a little work. While the aesthetic is similar to Stallman’s other articles, the text is small, isn’t arranged in an easy-to-read layout, and lacks any <i>italics</i> or <b>bold</b> to highlight specific points that he is trying to make. Most of the text is uniform size, and there are no headers to divide some of the subtopics within the article. </p>
                <p>There are also no graphics of any sort; a simple graphic might make anyone who wants to transition to using Stallman’s suggested pronouns understand when to use ‘perse’, ‘per’, or ‘pers’ a bit more clearly, although the article does state that ‘perse’ is equivalent to ‘he/she’, ‘per’ to ‘him/her’, and ‘pers’ to ‘his/hers’. <b>Still, I think a simple chart would clear things up.</b> To that end, I have made a chart that you can reference.</p>
                <div class="chart">
                    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matkisso/matkisso.github.io/master/resources/Genderless_pronouns.jpg" class="chart-image">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>I also think some graphics with the examples would help the examples to stand out on the page and further emphasize the point of the article.</p>
                <p>That being said, the text of the article itself is well written, provides good examples of this problematic phenomenon, provides a good solution, and explains why the solution is ideal. I also appreciate that Stallman identifies counterarguments, concedes certain parts of their logic, but acknowledges flaws in their reasoning.</p>
                <p>Currently the article’s authority and credibility primarily relies on Stallman’s computer science prowess, but with a few tweaks I think it would be better and maybe more people would pay attention to the message.</p>
